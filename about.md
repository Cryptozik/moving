## 2. Wait for one cycle

**With Hodl.farm, you do not need to wait five cycles. Delegate to us and get your payout faster!**

A Tezos cycle lasts about three days. You need to delegate to us for **one full cycle** to get your first payout.

For example, if you delegate to us in the middle of cycle 475, your first payout will be at the start of cycle 477.
